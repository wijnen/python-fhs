The xdg basedir specification is here:
http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

It specifies where programs should look for files to read, and where they
should write to.  This module uses this system to let a program use it without
worrying about the implementation.

For configuration, it does this by allowing them to be in any allowed location,
and reading the commandline to check for overrides.  For data, it gives a list
of data files, or the place to write it.  For cache, it gives you the name to
write it.

All functions use the packagename to determine the path.  This name uses the
basename of the executable without extension by default, but can be overruled.

Functions provided:
packagename (name)
	Set package name.
save_config (config, filename = None)
	Write configuration (dict) to filename, or to a default filename if
	none is given.
load_config (filename = None, defaults = None)
	Load and merge configuration from all available files.  Also, parse
	commandline and override anything with it.  Default values van be given
	in a dict; if a default key is given, but the value is None, it is
	required to be present in a config file or on the command line.
	This function automatically provides commandline access to alternate
	configuration files using --configfile, and to store the given
	configuration using --saveconfig.
data_filename_write (filename, makedirs = True, packagename = None)
	Return full path which should be used for writing application data.
	Given filename should be relative to the directory where the data
	directory.
	If makedirs is True, all directories will be created so open will work.
	packagename can be used to override the packagename.
data_files_read (filename, packagename = None)
	Return a list of file paths which match the given filename, which
	should be relative to the data directories.  Packagename can be used to
	override the packagename.
	Only existing files will be returned; the returned list may be empty.
cache_filename_write (filename = None, makedirs = True, packagename = None)
	Same as data_filename_write, but for cache file.
cache_filename_read (filename = None, packagename = None)
	Return the path of the cache file, or None if it does not exist.

These functions are used by save_config and load_config, and should not be used
directly.
config_filename_write (filename = None, packagename = None)
	Same as data_filename_write, but for config files.
config_files_read (filename = None, packagename = None)
	Same as data_files_read, but for config files.

The XDG environment variables (or their defaults) can be accessed as variables:
XDG_CONFIG_HOME
XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
XDG_DATA_HOME
XDG_DATA_DIRS
XDG_CACHE_HOME
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

Note that the latter does not have a default.  Furthermore, there is no good
standard way for using it, so no convenience function exists for it.
